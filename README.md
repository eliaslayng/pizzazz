Pizzazz

I am not really familiar with markdown yet, but I will still try to write this readme.
Pizzazz is a program, well really a page, that allows a user to open something with _-pizzazz-_.
It has an input, and two buttons. 
The user inputs a url, and upon hitting the 'Go!' button, they are redirected to the url they inputted. 
Although, they do not have to put in the full url. 
The user may put in just the main part of the url. (for example, 'youtube' instead of 'https://youtube.com')
This program's purpose is to add the _pizzazz_ so that it is easier for the user to navigate the web.
Although I said there were two buttons, not just one... what was that other one?
The second button is a button that takes the input that the user types, and turns it into a google search term. (essentially, a search box)
The reason I also added the google search button is so that this page can be used fully as a start page, and if the user is not familiar with the url of the website they would like to visit, they can search instead.
Also, as a bonus, upon clicking the 'pizzazz' logo on the page, the background will switch between dark and light mode. This preference is also saved in the users local memory so that the next time the page is loaded, their background theme preference will be saved.
If you would like to test this program, download it and open in your web browser of choice. I also spent some time to make sure the colors were right.
Updates will be coming, I do want to hopefully add a full preference page, so the user can change the search engine, and color of the UI. 
    Enjoy!   :)
